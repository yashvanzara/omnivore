                                                                        </p><p>

                                                                            </p><p>
                                                                                During Trump&#39;s <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/elon-musk-trump-2668951495/" target="_blank">interview on X with tech billionaire Musk</a>, the MAGA leader said his Democratic rival has received a &#34;free ride&#34; from the media so far.

And actually she looked very much like a great first lady: Melania. She didn&#39;t look like Camilla. That&#39;s right. But of course she&#39;s a beautiful woman. So we&#39;ll leave it at that.&#34;
                                                                            </p><p>

Prosecutors initially pushed for Lavrenz to serve up to 10 months in prison for continuing to defend the insurrection, writing in a recent filing that “her unrepentant promotion of the riot is powerful evidence that she continues to pose a threat to future acts of political violence.”
